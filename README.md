🎯 Objective
To develop an AI-powered system that leverages crop images and real-time environmental data to detect plant diseases early and provide actionable recommendations for treatment and prevention.

💡 Solution Overview
We propose a scalable and accessible mobile and web-based application that integrates machine learning models and real-time environmental data to:

Detect crop diseases using image analysis

Predict disease outbreaks based on environmental factors

Deliver real-time alerts to farmers

Provide tailored treatment and preventive recommendations

🔑 Key Features
🧠 AI Image Analysis: Detects crop diseases using deep learning models trained on plant image datasets.

🌦 Environmental Data Integration: Enhances prediction accuracy by considering temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

🔔 Real-Time Alerts: Notifies farmers about possible disease risks in their region.

📋 Actionable Insights: Offers disease-specific treatment and prevention plans.

📱 User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive mobile and web UI built for ease of use by farmers with minimal technical background.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Layer	Technologies Used
Frontend	React Native (Mobile), ReactJS (Web)
Backend	Node.js, Express
ML Models	Python (TensorFlow / PyTorch)
Database	MongoDB (Crop data, images, environmental data)
Cloud	AWS (Model hosting, data storage & services)

🚀 Expected Outcomes
📈 Increased Yield: Early detection empowers farmers to act swiftly and protect their crops.

💰 Cost Savings: Reduces losses and minimizes treatment costs through timely interventions.

🌍 Scalable Impact: Adaptable across diverse crops and geographic regions for broad applicability.
